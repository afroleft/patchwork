### Patchwork is Growing. Grow with us!

Backed by the Harvard Business Angels, partnered with the British Medical Journal and founded by former NHS Doctors, Patchwork is being brought to life by a talented and diverse team of designers, engineers, and implementers.


### Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre working on...

Patchwork connects Doctors directly with shifts in Hospitals. This is saving the NHS millions (and counting), keeps clinicians happy and makes sure a doctor is there when you need one most.

You can think of Patchwork as a marketplace, one side Hospitals, another side Doctors.

* For Hospitals: Patchwork ramps up the recruitment of doctors, meaning more people are ready to book your vacant shifts. It automates repetitive tasks‚Äîenabling shifts to be requested, filled and paid faster than yesterday.
* For Doctors: Patchwork enables you to join healthcare organisations that are local to you. You can browse available shifts, see relevant shifts recommended to you, book instantly and get paid on time.
