Patchwork is Growing. Grow with us!

---

Backed by the Harvard Business Angels, partnered with the BMJ and founded by former NHS Doctors, Patchwork is being brought to life by a talented and diverse team of designers, engineers, and implementers.

## Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre working on...

Patchwork connects clinicians (think Doctors, Nurses) directly with vacant shifts. This is saving the NHS millions (and counting), keeps clinicians happy and makes sure a doctor is there when you need one most.

You can think of Patchwork as a marketplace product, one side Employers, another side Clinicians.

- For Employers: Patchwork ramps up the recruitment of clinicians, meaning more people are ready to book your vacant shifts. It automates repetitive tasks‚Äîenabling shifts to be requested, filled and paid faster than yesterday.
- For Clinicians: Patchwork enables you to join healthcare organisations that are local to you. You can browse available shifts in realtime, have relevant shifts recommended to you, book instantly and get paid on time.
